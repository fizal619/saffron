"Saffron Catering has made me fall in love with indian food and now I'm not sure how to control myself. Two of my favorites are the Barfi and omg the crispy bite sizes samosas (ate almost 2 dozens by myself) with the tamarind sauce. This is perfect for any event as an appetizer. I love that they offer different fillings for these. I definitely recommend Saffron Catering for big or small events since they are reliable and professional, but most importantly they love what they do. Which is making their customers happy!"
