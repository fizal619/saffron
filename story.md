Saffron Catering was founded by a dynamic mother-daugther duo in 2016. Our goal was to share our love of homemade Indian cuisine with others, and from the heart of our home, began Saffron Fine Indian Catering; made with all the love, and care as we would for our own home.

Over time our name was shortened to Saffron Catering, but we continued to serve up fine Indian cuisine with the finest spices from around the world. Coupled with fresh, local herbs and ingredients, our menu is strategic in creating mouthwatering dishes that cater for the entire family. From our vegan to gluten free options, we ensure there's something for everyone.

We invite you to browse through our website, place an order, call our number, or message us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/saffroncateringgy), [Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/saffroncateringgy/)or [WhatsApp](https://wa.me/message/DNU575YSQMGRO1).
